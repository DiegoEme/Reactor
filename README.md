Mathematical modeling of a chemical reactor 


Mathematical modeling of a chemical reactor governed under the advection-reaction-diffusion equation. 
A parabolic partial differential equation was first converted to a dimensionless equation as well as its boundary conditions. 
Then, it was discretized using Crank Nicholson differences and finally a code was developed in fortran 90.
